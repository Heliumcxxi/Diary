# Diary

This is my diary recording the learning journey of frontend development. 

After completing my first protfolio project. I felt the need to comprehend my understanding on frontend fundamentals such as the meaning behind the tags and structures of the HTML and CSS files. I believe that being able to explain concepts and terminologies in a simple way is important to understand things. So this repository is my records on things I have learned.


I check reference from difference sources such as MDN and more. Full list below:
