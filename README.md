# Diary

This is my diary recording the learning journey of frontend development. 

After completing my first protfolio project. I felt the need to comprehend my understanding on frontend fundamentals such as the meaning behind the tags and structures of the HTML and CSS files. I believe writing diary-like and being able to explain concepts and terminologies I check reference from difference sources such as MDN and more.
