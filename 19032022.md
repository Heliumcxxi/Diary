What is HTML

    HTML = HyperText Markup Language

    Why?

    HTML is a language which is responsible to markup the meaning and structure of web contents. To understand the meanings behind the abbreviation:

        - HyperText: HTML can 

            1)annotate text and things beyond the limitation of text in a Web browser. e.g. picture, video, audio and animation. 
            2)facilitate linkages between different documents on different servers. 

        So HTML enables us to watch thing naturally and seamlessly on a web page. 

        - Markup: HTML is a dscriptive markup language. Things show on a web page is marked up by HTML with tags such as <a>, <img> or <p>, etc and interpreted by rendering engine. Being a markup language also means HTML doesn't compile or require a compiler like a programming languague.


Basic structure of HTML

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>

Script above demostrates the fundamental elements in a HTML file. <!DOCTYPE html> is DocType Declaration (DTD). DTD can indicate the HTML standard the document is adopted. <html lang> declares the language of the document to assist browsers and search engines to determine the default language of the page.

<head>
The <head> of an HTML document marks the specifications of the doc. Elements in this part are not displayed in web pages but they are the metadata of the document. There are several metadata in the <head>:

<meta charset="UTF-8">
